I am a master’s student at the **Institute of Applied Mathematics**,  
**National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)**, Taiwan.

My current research focuses on **matroid theory**, particularly on the algebraic and topological aspects of **realization spaces**. I am also exploring connections with **Gröbner bases** and **White’s Conjecture**.
