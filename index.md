# Yu-Chuan YU 游棫荃

I am a master’s student in the **Institute of Applied Mathematics** at  
**National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)**, Taiwan.

My current research focuses on the algebraic and topological structures arising in **matroid theory**, including **realization spaces** and **White’s Conjecture**, with connections to **Gröbner bases**. I am also interested in formal verification and constructive proof systems.
